## Instructions

To play the game, use `gradle run` and click the Start Game button. Select your level and the notes from the song will start moving towards you. Select the key on your number pad that corresponds to the box on screen whenever it is touching the front boxes on screen. If you push/hold the button at that right time, you will earn points, but if you press at the wrong time, you will lose points. You can use ESC to pause or leave the level. But you press ESC again when game is paused, the music and game will resume.

There are three built-in levels (easy, medium, and hard). Choose the level you want to play and get the power-up items during the game. They may change your perspective, double incoming scores, and cover your misclicks. Check your score after playing game and challenge yourself for higher scores!

If you want to create your own level, you can do so by opening the LevelDesigner project.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
